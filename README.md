# Cardiovascular-Prediction-Using-ML

#### Week 1: Datasets Collection
- Collected two datasets named "Framingham Heart Study Dataset" and "Heart Disease Dataset".
  
#### Week 2: Recent Conference Papers Collection
- Gathered recent conference papers related to cardiovascular risk assessment from sources like IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ICCSP '24.

#### Week 3: EDA and Data Preprocessing
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on both datasets to gain insights into the data.
- Preprocessed the datasets by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

#### Week 4: ML and Hybrid Algorithms
- Applied machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict cardiovascular risk.
- Explored hybrid algorithms combining traditional ML with deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.

#### Week 5 & 6: Paper Writing in IEEE Standards
- Authored a paper summarizing our findings and methodology.
- Complete Wriitng of Paper
  
#### Final Week
- Presented our paper at ICCSP '24 organized by IEEE.
- We got certificates for our paper presentation to Publish in IEEE
- Contributors: Charitavya Madala, Deepak Tallapudi, Srikari Malladi, Mahitha Chimata.
